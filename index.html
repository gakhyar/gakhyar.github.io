          spectra representing algebraic cobordism and algebraic
          K-theory</a>, with V. Snaith. Documenta Mathematica, Vol. 14
        (2009), 359-396.<br>
        We elucidate the structure of the motivic spectra representing
        Voevodsky's algebraic cobordism and Weibel's homotopy-invariant
        algebraic K-theory. Our main result is that, over a base scheme
        S, inverting the canonical Bott classes in BGL = colim_n BGL_n
        and BG_m we obtain MGL and KGL, respectively, generalizing and
        reproving a famous theorem of Snaith in topology. As corollaries
        we deduce that both are canonically E_\infty motivic spectra
        with a universal "mapping out of" property, and as a further
        application we construct a motivic Conner-Floyd isomorphism.<br>

        We study twisted generalized cohomology from the point of view
        of stable homotopy theory and infinity-category theory. In
        particular, we explain the relationship to twisted K-theory via
        Frebholm bundles and show that, in contrast to the case of
        K-theory, elliptic cohomology admits twists by degree four
        cohomology classes, and more generally by maps to the four-stage
        Postnikov system BO&lt;0...4&gt;. We also discuss Poincare

        We show that (nonconnective) algebraic K-theory, viewed as a
        functor from small stable infinity-categories to spectra, is the
        universal additive (respectively, localizing) invariant. To
        prove these results we construct and study varieties of
        noncommutative motives over the sphere, and show that algebraic
        K-theory is the functor corepresented by the motive of the
        sphere. The technical backbone of the paper relies on a
        comparison which exhibits the infinity-category of small stable
        infinity-categories as the localization of spectrally-enriched
        categories obtained by inverting Morita equivalences. As an
        application we obtain a complete classification of trace maps,
        i.e. natural transformations from K-theory to THH and TC (or
        other pro-localizing theories), as well as a canonical
        construction of the cyclotomic trace.<br>

        Blumberg, M.J. Hopkins and C. Rezk. Journal of Topology (2013).<br>
        We develop a generalization of the theory of Thom spectra using
        the language of infinity categories. This language allows us to
        develop a clean treatment of parametrized homotopy theory which
        avoids the pathology encountered in model-dependent settings.
        For any associative ring spectrum R, we associate a Thom
        spectrum to a map from a space X to the classifying space
        BGL_1(R) of the A_infinity space GL_1(R), which classifies local
        systems of free rank one R-modules (a.k.a. R-line bundles). We
        use our R-module Thom spectrum to define the twisted
        R-(co)homology of an R-line bundle over X and to obtain a
        generalized theory of orientations in this context. We conclude
        with an abstract characterization the Thom spectrum which allows
        us to compare to the classical case (i.e. for R the sphere

        In this paper we develop the basic theory of generalized Thom
        spectra using an explicit point-set version of loop space theory
        involving spaces and spectra with actions of the linear
        isometries operad. We extend the theory of Thom spectra and the
        associated obstruction theory for orientations in order to
        support the construction of the string orientation of tmf, the
        spectrum of topological modular forms. We also develop the
        analogous theory of Thom spectra and orientations for
        associative ring spectra. Our work is based on a new model for
        the Thom spectrum as a derived smash product.<br>

        Making use of the theory of noncommutative motives, we

        multiplicative natural transformation from algebraic K-theory to
        THH and the cyclotomic trace map as the unique multiplicative

        structures on algebraic K-theory is contractible and that the
        algebraic K-theory functor from small stable infinity categories
        to spectra is lax symmetric monoidal, so that E_n-ring spectra
        give rise to E_{n-1}-ring algebraic K-theory spectra. The key
        technical ingredient is a version of a multiplicative Morita

        In this paper we study Azumaya algebras and Brauer groups in
        derived algebraic geometry. We establish various fundamental
        facts about Brauer groups in this setting, and we provide a
        computational tool which we use to compute the Brauer group in
        several examples. In particular, we show that the Brauer group
        of the sphere spectrum vanishes, and we use this to prove two
        uniqueness theorems for the stable homotopy category. Our key
        technical results include the local geometricity, in the sense
        of Artin infinity-stacks, of the moduli space of perfect modules
        over a smooth and proper ring spectrum, the étale local
        triviality of Azumaya algebras over connective derived schemes,

        We set up a general theory of weak or homotopy-coherent
        enrichment in an arbitrary monoidal infinity-category. Our
        theory has many desirable properties which render it useful even
        when the theory in question admits a model (as sometimes occurs
        in examples of interest, e.g. differential-graded categories,
        spectral categories, (infinity, n)-categories, etc.). We
        construct our theory via a non-symmetric version of Lurie's
        infinity-operads, and develop their basic theory, following
        Lurie's treatment of symmetric infinity-operads. Lastly, we
        present some applications, including the identification of
        algebras as a coreflective subcategory of pointed enriched
        infinity-categories, and a proof of a strong version of the

        We establish a canonical and unique tensor product for
        commutative monoids and groups in an infinity-category which
        generalizes the ordinary tensor product of abelian groups. Using
        this tensor product we show that E_n-(semi)ring objects in give
        rise to E_n-ring spectrum objects by group completion. In the
        case of the infinity-category of spaces this produces a
        multiplicative infinite loop space machine which can be applied
        to algebraic K-theory of rings and connective ring spectra. A
        central theme is the stability of algebraic structures under
        basechange; for example, Ring(D\otimes C)=Ring(D)\otimes C. We
        conclude with a treatment of these algebraic structures from the

        The K-theory of endomorphisms KEnd, as well as the
        closely-related K-theory of automorphisms KAut, are refinements
        of algebraic K-theory which capture important arithmetic

        conjecture of Almkvist from the 1970's on the classification of
        natural transformations of the KEnd functor: specifically, we
        show that the set of such transformations&nbsp; bijects with the
        product of the integers with the multiplicative group of
        rational functions with unit constant term. Moreover, KEnd
        itself splits as a copy of algebraic K-theory plus a new
        spectrum-valued invariant which refines the rational Witt
        vectors (i.e. the dense subring of the Witt vectors consisting

        We develop the basic theory of locally cartesian localizations
        of presentable locally cartesian closed infinity-categories and
        show that univalent families, in the sense of Voevodsky, form a
        poset equivalent to the poset of bounded local classes, in the
        sense of Lurie. In particular, infinity-topoi admit a hierarchy
        of "universal" univalent families and n-topoi admit univalent
        families classifying (n-2)-truncated maps. We show that
        univalent families are preserved and detected by right adjoints
        to locally cartesian localizations and use this to exhibit
        canonical univalent families in infinity-quasitopoi. We also
        exhibit some exotic examples of univalent families, illustrating
        that a univalent family in an n-topos need not be

        In this paper we identify the fiber term in the algebraic
        K-theory of a localization of ring spectra as the algebraic
        K-theory of the endomorphism algebra spectrum of a Koszul-type
        complex. The original theorem along these lines is Quillen's
        famous localization sequence relating the algebraic K-theory of
        a number field to the algebraic K-theory of its ring of integers
        and residue fields, was generalized by Blumberg-Mandell (using a
        strong form a dévissage) to a localization sequence relating the
        algebraic K-theory of the integers with that of connective and
        periodic topological K-theory. This lead Rognes to expect the
        existence of analogous localization sequences at all chromatic

        We introduce a general theory of parametrized objects

        we establish our theory in the full generality of objects of an
        infinity-category parametrized by objects of an infinity-topos.
        We obtain a coherent functor formalism describing the
        relationship of the various adjoints of base-change and its
        symmetric monoidal structure, as well as fiberwise constructions
        of twisted Umkehr maps for twisted cohomology theories using a

        exhibit the algebraic structures on generalized Thom spectra and

          We define and discuss lax and weighted colimits of diagrams in

          In this paper we develop methods for studying Azumaya algebras
          over nonconnective commutative ring spectra. We construct and
          classify these algebras and their automorphisms using
          Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory and give descent-theoretic
          tools, applying results of Lurie to show that a finite Galois
          extension of rings in the sense of Rognes becomes a homotopy
          fixed-point equivalence on Brauer spaces. For even-periodic
          ring spectra, we find that the algebraic Azumaya algebras

          Brauer-Wall group of pi_0(E), recovering a result of

        The purpose of this paper is to introduce a homotopy theory of
        topological Artin stacks which has the feature that the usual
        G-equivariant unstable categories naturally embed fully
        faithfully into the homotopy theory of stacks over the
        classifying stack BG. The resulting infinity-category has since
        been dubbed the "global unstable homotopy category", and has
        many interesting features. The technical apparatus underlying
        our construction is a fibrant replacement endofunctor of
        topological groupoids has the curious feature that the presheaf
        the groupoids represented by a topological groupoid is a stack
        if and only if the topological groupoid is fibrant. This allows
